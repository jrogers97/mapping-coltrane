					<p>Perhaps the biggest culmination of Coltrane’s African influence was his 1961 conceptual album Africa/Brass. It is perhaps his most adventurous album, featuring a full big band orchestra. His use of African rhythms throughout, and specifically on the titular track, Africa, was inspired by his friend, Yoruban percussionist, Babatunde Olatunji.</p>
					<p>Wilbur Harden’s Dial Africa was recorded by Coltrane in 1958, and carried a similar conceptual weight. Coltrane’s African influence can also be seen through his spirituality, with Coltrane citing Olatunji and African cultures as influential in that regard.</p>

					<p>Recorded: October 21, 1960 - October, 1965</p>
					<p>Songs: <span class="bold">India, Om, My Favorite Things</span></p>
					<p>In the early 1960’s, Coltrane’s music began to take a dramatic turn away from harmonic emphasis and playing over standard chord changes to modal playing and emphasis on interesting melodies. Integral to this shift was Coltrane’s interest in the music of Ravi Shankar. Shankar, noted for popularizing Hindustani (North Indian) music in America in the 60s, helped Coltrane integrate classical Indian techniques into his music. This location marks the birthplace of Shankar.
					</p>
					<p>Three notable songs that utilize Indian devices are India, Om, and My Favorite Things. India, based on a recorded Vedic chant, was first played at the Village Vanguard in 1961, and showcases a huge emphasis on Indian modes and “ragas” (melodic concepts). </p>
					<p>Om, which refers to the sacred syllable used in Hinduism, was recorded in 1965, and is overt in its integration of Indian religion. It is said that Coltrane’s intention with his “modal phase” and use of Indian motifs is to expand the listener’s consciousness. </p>
					<p>My Favorite Things, a rendition of the famous Hammerstein and Rodgers tune, uses drone tones and modality to inspire a Hindustani feel. The song begins in E minor, but shifts to E major for the solo section, over which Coltrane plays stunning modal riffs.</p>

					<p>Coltrane and his wife Alice (he and Naima had divorced) moved to this Long Island house in 1964. It was in this home that Coltrane composed the music for the album A Love Supreme. In 2004, the Huntington Society purchased the house to save it from demolition. The “Coltrane Home” is now a non-profit organization. </p>
